# Mixomate
This project is to create the protein mix mashine "Mixomate".

The Plan is to create a Opensource "Mixomate" to mix a proteinshake.
It is foreseen that all parts are going to be able to be printed via a 3D printer (electrical parts like mix engine, display, controller etc. must be bought).
All parts can be assembled userfriendly.
Maybe in the future the Mixomate can be bought as a finished product.

Mixomate is going to be able to:

    - Select the amount of protein powder for a shake
        - this is done by a weight cell

    - Mix Water with the Powder
        - Duration of mixing time is selectable via UI
        - Speed is selecable via UI
        - Water tank and Pump are going to be a plan for the future

    - UI is going to be attached via a Display on the front of the Mixomate

    - Connect to Wlan

    - Wireless smartphone connection (Plan for the future)
    
   
All required and developed items are going to be listed in this Repo
This includes the Code, electronic devices as well as 3D Printed Parts
